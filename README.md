# **Resumate**

Imagine this: you're a student, a job seeker, or someone stuck in a career you don’t love. You know there's more out there, you know you need to upskill, but where do you even start?

You search online. Thousands of courses, free certifications, and career guides pop up. But instead of feeling hopeful, you feel overwhelmed. Which course is legit? Which one actually helps? Should you learn coding, digital marketing, or UX design? And even if you choose one, who tells you what’s next?

People give up, not because they lack ambition, but because they lack direction. They end up settling for jobs that don’t fulfill them, scrolling past opportunities they don’t even know exist.

## **Problem Statement**

Many job seekers struggle to find the right career path, optimize their resumes, and prepare for interviews. While free resources exist, they’re scattered and hard to navigate. Without personalized guidance, people waste time on trial and error.
